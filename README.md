# SASecureFace
This project is an experimental prototype that uses **YOLO** and **CLIP** models to detect faces and specific hair styles from either live camera feeds or directly from the monitor screen.

⚠️ This is a **test-only prototype**. It must **never be used in real life**. Do not judge anyone based on physical appearance.

Some gangs and harmful groups tend to adopt specific hair styles. This tool explores whether such patterns can be detected early using semantic filtering. It captures faces from the screen, compares them to a user-defined hair style prompt using CLIP, and highlights matches.
